# Deep Sort with PyTorch

## Introduction
This is an implement of MOT tracking algorithm deep sort. Deep sort is basicly the same with sort but added a CNN model to extract features in image of human part bounded by a detector. This CNN model is indeed a RE-ID model and the detector used in [PAPER](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07402) is FasterRCNN , and the original source code is [HERE](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort).  
However in original code, the CNN model is implemented with tensorflow, which I'm not familier with. SO I re-implemented the CNN feature extraction model with PyTorch, and changed the CNN model a little bit. Also, I use **YOLOv3** to generate bboxes instead of FasterRCNN.

## Quick Start
0. Check all dependencies installed
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Download YOLOv3 parameters
```
cd detector/YOLOv3/weight/
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights
cd ../../../
```

2. Compile nms module
```bash
cd detector/YOLOv3/nms
sh build.sh
cd ../../..
```

Notice:
If compiling failed, the simplist way is to **Upgrade your pytorch >= 1.1 and torchvision >= 0.3" and you can avoid the troublesome compiling problems which are most likely caused by either `gcc version too low` or `libraries missing`.

5. Run demo
```
usage: python yolov3_deepsort.py VIDEO_PATH
                                [--help]
                                [--frame_interval FRAME_INTERVAL]
                                [--config_detection CONFIG_DETECTION]
                                [--config_deepsort CONFIG_DEEPSORT]
                                [--display]
                                [--display_width DISPLAY_WIDTH]
                                [--display_height DISPLAY_HEIGHT]
                                [--save_path SAVE_PATH]          
                                [--cpu]          

# yolov3 + deepsort
python yolov3_deepsort.py [VIDEO_PATH]

# yolov3_tiny + deepsort
python yolov3_deepsort.py [VIDEO_PATH] --config_detection ./configs/yolov3_tiny.yaml

# yolov3 + deepsort on webcam
python3 yolov3_deepsort.py /dev/video0 --camera 0

# yolov3_tiny + deepsort on webcam
python3 yolov3_deepsort.py /dev/video0 --config_detection ./configs/yolov3_tiny.yaml --camera 0
```
Use `--display` to enable display.  
Results will be saved to `./output/results.avi` and `./output/results.txt`.
